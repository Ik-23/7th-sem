STAGES OF EVOLUTION OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
The evolutionary process of entrepreneurship activities may be divided in to the following broad stages:
1. Hunting Stage: 
- The primary stage of the evolution of the economic life of man was hunting stage.
- Wants were limited and very few in numbers. 
- The family members themselves satisfied problems of food, clothing and shelter. Producers were the consumers also. 
- Robinson Crusoe, living in the deserted island, satisfying his own requirements had no knowledge of business. People in some parts of Africa and India still lead this type of life. In this stage problems of production and distribution were not complex since wants were simple and limited.

2.Pastoral Stage: 
With the progress of mankind gradually mental understanding developed and people started realizing that instead of killing animals, they should breed and rear them. Thus cattle breeding encouraged the use of milk, and they had to think in terms of grazing areas for their cattle. The surplus milk, meat and other related products were spared of exchange. This stage can be termed as the first stage of economic development and the beginning of commerce.

3. Agricultural Stage: 
In search of grazing areas, they further realized that they should grow plants as food for animals. They started testing some grain products and slowly developed a taste in plants and the land was used for cultivation. Groups of persons started living together on their agricultural fields, which were subsequently converted into small villages with their farms. Free exchange of goods was started and the activities were also divided to the extent of division of labor at the village level to complement the needs of each other. Initially each village was self sufficient, but later they began small trading activities on barter basis

4. Handicraft Stage: 
In the agricultural stage, people started learning the use of cloth made of cotton products, and they developed the segments of the workers for different activities. Cottage scale setup was developed at the village level to nearby villages, and in exchange they brought requirements either to consume themselves or for their village friends. Since the demand for gold coins, silver coins, skin etc increased the activities of cobblers, gold smiths, and blacksmiths, laborers also rapidly increased, and caste system was also formed on the basis of activities they did. Every body selected their job according to their own choice and taste

5. Present Industrial Stage:
The use of mechanical devices and the commonly acceptable form of monetary system accelerated the growth of entrepreneurship activities. The progress of science and the increase in the means of transportation and communication enabled to travel widely and the markets were developed in the country and abroad
