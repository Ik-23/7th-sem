DIRECTING
Directing is telling people what to do & seeing that they do it to the best of their ability
	- Ernest Dole

Principles of Direction
1. Harmony of Objectives:
For org to function well, the goals of company & goals of individuals are in complete harmony.
2. Unit direction of Command:
An employee should receive orders & instructions only from one supervisor.
3. Efficiency:
Supervisor consulting subordinates in decision making improves sense of commitment, thus making direction easy and efficient.
4. Direct Supervision:
Manager should have face-to-face contact with the subordinates.
5. Effective Communication:
Supervisor must have good communication skills so that plans, goals, policies, responsibilities & the duties are communicated properly.
6. Effective Control:
The management should monitor the behavior and performance of subordinates to exercise effective control over subordinates.
7. Follow Through:
Having given the directions may not ensure carrying out them. Hence manager should follow through the performances of the subordinates. Follow up is very important function of direction.

=================================

Motivation
Motivation is the willingness of a person to exert high levels of effort to satisfy some individual need or want.


McGregor’s Theory X and Y
Two sets of assumptions about the nature of people. These two sets of assumptions obviously are fundamentally different.
- Theory X is pessimistic, static, and rigid. Control is primarily external, imposed on the subordinate by the superior. 
- Theory Y is optimistic, dynamic, and flexible, with an emphasis on self-direction and the integration of individual needs with organizational demands. 

Theory X Assumptions
The “traditional” assumptions about the nature of people, according to McGregor, are included in Theory X as follows :
1. Average human beings have a inherent dislike of work and will avoid it if they can.
2. Because of this human characteristic of disliking work, most people must be coerced, controlled, directed, and threatened with punishment to get them to put forth adequate effort toward the achievement of organizational objectives.
3. Average human beings prefer to be directed, wish to avoid responsibility have relatively little ambition, and want security above all.

Theory Y Assumptions
McGregor sees the assumptions under Theory Y as follows :
1. The expenditure of physical and mental effort in work is as natural as play or rest.
2. External control and the threat of punishment are not the only mean for producing effort toward organizational objectives. People will exercise self-direction and self-control in the service of objectives to which they are committed. 
3. The degree of commitment to objectives is proportion to the size of the rewards associated with their achievement. 
4. Average human beings learn, under proper conditions, not only to accept responsibility but also to seek it.
5. The capacity to exercise a relatively high degree of imagination and creativity in the solution of organizational problems is widely, not narrowly, distributed in the population.
6. Under the conditions of modern industrial life, the intellectual potentialities of the average human being are only partially utilized.

Theory X
People are lazy
People lack ambition 
Dislike responsibility
People are self-centered
People don’t like change

Theory Y
People are energetic
People want to make contributions
People do have ambition
People will seek responsibility

Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs Theory
- When one set of needs is satisfied, this kind of need ceases to be a motivator.

The Needs Hierarchy
The basic human needs placed by Maslow in an ascending order of importance and shown in figure 1 are :
- Physiological needs (85% satisfied).
- Security, or safety, needs (70% satisfied).
- Affiliation, or acceptance, needs (50% satisfied).
- Esteem needs (40% satisfied).
- Need for self-actualization (85% satisfied).

figure in ppt DIRECTING or LEADING-2

Self-Actualization Needs
- represent the need for self-fulfillment
Esteem Needs
- desire for a positive self-image and to receive attention
Belongingness  Needs
- desire to be accepted by one’s peers
Safety Needs

Physiological Needs
